Diabetes Progression Prediction Using ANN

This project aims to build and evaluate an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict diabetes progression using various patient features. The dataset is the well-known Diabetes dataset from sklearn, and the goal is to help healthcare professionals understand how different factors influence diabetes progression.
Objective:

    Predict diabetes progression using a neural network model.
    Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error and R-squared Score.
    Improve the model through hyperparameter tuning and architectural changes.

Steps:

    Loading and Preprocessing:
        The dataset was loaded and normalized using StandardScaler for optimal model performance.

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
        Visualizations of feature distributions and relationships with the target variable were performed using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

    ANN Model Building:
        A basic ANN was built using Keras, consisting of one hidden layer with relu activation and one output layer for regression tasks.

    Model Training:
        The ANN model was trained using the Adam optimizer and MSE as the loss function over 100 epochs.

    Model Evaluation:
        The model was evaluated on testing data, with performance measured by MSE and R-squared.

    Improving the Model:
        An improved model was created by experimenting with additional layers and neurons, which resulted in better performance.

Results:

    The original and improved models were compared, with significant performance gains from the improved architecture.
